I added the images.

Usually, before I add images to a website, I run them through a website called https://tinypng.com/, which ofter reduces the file size significantly. I did that for these images, and it made them 38% smaller. Those are the ones I uploaded to the site, but I can use the originals if you'd prefer.

I also realized Bargello Trees and Whiskers weren't on Winter/Christmas, so I added them.

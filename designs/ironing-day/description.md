If it's Tuesday, it must be Ironing Day. This is the fifth design in The Needle's Notion Days of the Week sampler series.

All of the samplers are stitched with DMC floss on 32 count Platinum Belfast Linen and measure approximately 5 5/8 x 15 inches.

**Ironing Day Correction**

If you have previously purchased my Ironing Day design, a small section of the chart may be missing from page two of your pattern. You can download a new page two here, or contact me and I'll mail you a copy of the correction. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

The Days of the Week sampler series includes:
Wash Day, Baking Day , Cleaning Day, Market Day, Ironing Day, Sewing Day, Day of Rest

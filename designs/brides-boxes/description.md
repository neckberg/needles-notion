In this new design from The Needle's Notion, a Colonial bride and groom are standing atop three bride's boxes, stacked to resemble a layered wedding cake.

Bride's boxes were a traditional gift given by the groom to his bride on their wedding day, especially during the 1700s and early 1800s. This form of folk art was popular in Scandinavia, Germany and early America. The boxes in this design have traditional folk art motifs and a motto inspired by a Colonial era love letter.

The model is worked on 28 count Antique Ivory Cashel Linen using DMC and Weeks Dye Works floss.

Design size: 7 x 11 inches

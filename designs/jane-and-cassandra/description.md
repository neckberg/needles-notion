This unique sampler from The Needle's Notion pays homage to novelist Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra, and includes interpretations of several motifs from needlework pieces attributed to the two sisters.

Having visited the Austens' Chawton Cottage home and viewed some of their needlework in person, I wished to create an original sampler inspired by their work, while incorporating my own designs influenced by the English countryside.

Finishing instructions for the pin keep, needle book and sampler ribbon edgings are included with the chart. The three designs are stitched on 28 count Light Mocha Cashel Linen with threads from The Gentle Art and DMC.

Sampler Stitch Count: 140 wide x 112 high.

Finished size of pin keep and needle book: 5½ x 4½ inches and 3¼ x 3¼ inches.

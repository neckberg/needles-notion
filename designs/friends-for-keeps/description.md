Inspired by traditional spot samplers, this heart warming design celebrates friendship. The main sampler features a boy and girl holding a basket of flowers.

In addition, an optional chart is included to stitch a friendship design with two girls.

The designs are stitched with DMC and Weeks Dye Works threads on 32 count Country French Latte Linen from Wichelt Imports.

Design sizes: 7 1/2 x 10 1/2 inches and 6 x 4 1/2 inches

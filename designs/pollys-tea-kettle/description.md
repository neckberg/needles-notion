The Needle's Notion has created another charming design featuring a familiar nursery rhyme. Polly and her friends are dressed for a tea party reminiscent of the early 1800s. The little scene is pictured within a tea kettle shape, and the delicate sampler includes borders of stacked cups and Tea Leaf motifs found on antique ironstone dishes.

The model is worked on hand dyed 28 count Spice Blend Celtic Linen from Stitches and Spice, using floss from DMC and The Gentle Art.

Design size: 10 1/4 x 8 inches.

This is the second design in the Sampler Shapes series. The first design, [Lucy Locket Sampler](SITE_ROOT:designs/lucy-locket-sampler), was released earlier this year.

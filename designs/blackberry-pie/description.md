This little pie safe is filled with freshly-baked blackberry pies. The look of punched tin panels on the doors is created with backstitching and tiny French knots. The plump berries on the branches look good enough to eat, and a pair of blackbirds have even snitched a few for themselves!

Stitched with DMC and Gentle Art threads on 32 count Raw Belfast Linen.

Design size: 9 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches.

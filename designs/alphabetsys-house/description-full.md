This pastoral sampler scene features a yellow brick house perched on top of an alphabet hill. Instructions are included to finish AlphaBetsy's House as either a flat-backed piece for display or a sewing caddy with wool felt pockets to hold needlework tools.

Easy finishing instructions are also included for the AlphaBetsy pin cushion doll.

AphaBetsy's House design size: 6 ¾ x 5 ½ inches
Pin Cushion Doll finished size: 5 inches tall

Both designs are worked on 32 count Raw Belfast Linen using DMC and Gentle Art threads.

**Note:** The pin cushion doll's dress and collar should be stitched with DMC #727 Lt. Yellow. The incorrect symbol was mistakenly printed on a few of the charts.

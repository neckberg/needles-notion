This welcoming pin cushion was inspired by an antique cushion made in the historic Amana Colonies in Iowa.

Willkommen is German for welcome.

This charted needlepoint design works up quickly and includes all stitching and finishing instructions.

Worked on 18 mesh mono needlepoint canvas with Caron Watercolours and DMC threads.

Finished size of pin cushion: 4 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches.

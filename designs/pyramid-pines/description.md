This new chart features five different pyramid-shaped ornaments. Hang them up, and give them a spin to see the three stitched sides on each one. All stitching and finishing instructions are included to create these 4 inch-tall ornaments.

The designs are worked on 32 count Platinum Belfast Linen with DMC threads.

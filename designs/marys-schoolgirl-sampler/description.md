There really was a girl named Mary Sawyer whose pet lamb followed her to school one day in the early 1800s. This is the Needle's Notion's idea of the schoolgirl sampler that Mary could have stitched to commemorate her famous lamb's journey. In keeping with the spirit of traditional schoolgirl samplers, 12 specialty stitches are included on the design.

The chart includes patterns and finishing instructions to complete both an easel-backed sampler and a stand-up figure of Mary with her lamb.

Stitched with DMC and Gentle Art threads on 32 count Platinum Belfast Linen.
Note: DMC 3885 is a new color used on this design. If looking for a similar blue as a substitute, use DMC 824.

Design size of Mary's sampler: 6 ž x 6 ź inches
Finished size of Mary and lamb figure: 5 inches tall

Stitch a garden of whimsical delights, including a rabbit couple with their Cottontail Cottage and a stand-up Gardener Rabbit.
The chart includes patterns and finishing instructions to complete both the easel-backed cottage scene and the rabbit figure.

Stitched with DMC and Gentle Art threads on 32 count Raw Belfast Linen.

Design size of Cottontail Cottage: 6 3/4 x 7 1/2 inches
Finished size of Gardener Rabbit: 4 3/4 inches tall

## Gardener Rabbit Correction
On some charts, cheeks of rabbit include two squares with four small star symbols. These should simply be one large star, which represents Gentle Art Cinnamon thread.

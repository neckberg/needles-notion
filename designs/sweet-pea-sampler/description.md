This enchanting design from The Needle's Notion is truly a sampler of peas. There are sweet peas, garden peas, a row of letter Ps, and a little sweet pea girl with her apron full of flowers. Look closely and there are more surprises, including borders of green Rhodes circle peas and tiny letter Ps in a pod. Two ladybug Glass Treasures from Mill Hill and tendrils stitched with Kreinik emerald metallic braid add a bit of sparkle.

Stitched on 32 count Raw Belfast Linen with DMC embroidery floss.

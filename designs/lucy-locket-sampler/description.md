The old nursery rhyme about Lucy Locket losing her pocket, is illustrated in this delightful sampler shaped like an antique pocket. From the late 1600s to about 1850, women's pockets were separate articles of clothing, tied with strings around the waist. Lucy Locket Sampler is worked on 28 count Light Mocha Cashel Linen with threads from DMC and The Gentle Art.

Design size: 11 3/4 x 9 inches.

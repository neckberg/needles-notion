Summer can last forever when you stitch this fun Needle's Notion design. A little boy plays in the sand, accompanied by three seagull friends and a row of whimsical sea creatures. In the distance, a sailboat floats on a bargello-stitched sea.

Worked on 28 count Lambswool Linen with DMC floss.

Design size is 7 x 9 inches.

During a recent online Needlework Show, stitchers were asked to vote for the next design in The Needle's Notion Sampler Shapes series.

The overwhelming winner was a spool shape.

Sew a Fine Seam is based on the old nursery rhyme about Curly Locks, and features a needlework-themed design stitched within a spool shape.

Worked on 28 count Sandstone/Tea Dyed Linen from Wichelt Imports using DMC and Weeks Dye Works embroidery floss.

Design size: 8 1/2 x 15 inches.

The use of perforated paper to stitch mottos and motifs for pictures, bookmarks and other household items became popular during the mid to late 1800s.

This Willkommen design (German for welcome) was inspired by house blessing pictures often found in the Amana Colonies, an historic German community in Eastern Iowa. Many homes in the Amanas are covered with grapevines. Cross stitched on 14 count ecru perforated paper using DMC embroidery floss.

Design size: 9 1/2 x 6 1/4 inches

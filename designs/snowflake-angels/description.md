These pretty angels have snowflake wings stitched on perforated paper. All three angel designs are included with the chart, along with easy stitching and finishing instructions.

The dolls are worked on 32 count white Belfast Linen with Weeks Dye Works and DMC floss, and embellished with Mill Hill beads and Kreinik metallic braids.

Finished size: 6 1/2 inches tall.

**Correction:** On some of the Snowflake Angel charts, the small wings graph on the bottom of the page was printed upside down. This will not be a problem when cross stitching the wings. However, when attaching the finished wings to the back of the angel, flip the wings so the untrimmed corners are positioned on the lower inside edges.
